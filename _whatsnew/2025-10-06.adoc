=== BlueXP is now NetApp Console 

BlueXP has been renamed and redesigned to better reflect the role it has in managing your data infrastructure.

The NetApp Console (formerly BlueXP) provides centralized management of storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments at enterprise grade—delivering real-time insights, faster workflows, and simplified administration. For details on what’s changed, see the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-relnotes/index.html[NetApp Console release notes].
